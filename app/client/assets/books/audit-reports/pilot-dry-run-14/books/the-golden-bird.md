## Cleanup Risks

- title page, byline, publication, or copyright material appears before body content
- Project Gutenberg/source/license material must be removed

## Title/Default-Start Risks

- write pass must keep title/byline material out of default playback

## Segmentation Risks

- structure audit recommends processing with warnings; write pass must verify boundaries directly from raw source
- dry-run filtered at least one detector-selected wrapper heading; write pass must keep wrapper/source material out of playable sections

## Author Metadata Risks

- None.

## Collection-Title Leakage Risks

- ensure the generated title stays the individual story title and parent collection title/byline/source wrapper stays out of default playback

## Illustration/Page/Footnote Risks

- no obvious illustration/page-marker/footnote risk in snippets
