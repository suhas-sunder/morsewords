          <p>
            Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
            mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by
            website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
            efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies set by the website owner (in this case,
            https://www.morsewords.com) are called "first-party cookies."
            Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called
            "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party
            features or functionality to be provided on or through the website
            (for example, advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The
            parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your device
            both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits
            certain other websites.

          <h2 className="flex py-2 text-2xl">Why do we use cookies?</h2>
          <p>
            We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some
            cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website
            to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly
            necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to understand how our
            Website is used and to improve performance and user experience. We
            may also use cookies for advertising purposes, including serving ads
            and measuring ad performance. This is described in more detail
            below.

            Analytics and performance cookies
          </h2>
          <p>
            These cookies (and similar technologies) collect information that is
            used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Website
            is being used, to improve site performance, and to help diagnose
            errors. We currently use PostHog for analytics, which may set
            cookies or use similar identifiers depending on your browser and our
            configuration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note: The specific cookies and identifiers used can vary over time

          <p>
            We may display advertisements on our Website through Google AdSense
            and/or other advertising partners. Advertising providers may use
            cookies or similar technologies to serve ads, limit ad frequency,
            measure ad performance, and deliver ads that may be relevant to your
            interests.

          <h3 className="text-xl">Google advertising cookies</h3>
          <p>
            Google uses cookies to help serve the ads it displays on the
            websites of its partners, such as websites displaying Google ads or
            participating in Google certified ad networks. When users visit a
            Google partner website, a cookie may be dropped on that user's
            browser.

          <h2 className="flex py-2 text-2xl">How can I control cookies?</h2>
          <p>
            You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.
            You can usually exercise your cookie rights by setting your
            preferences in a cookie banner or consent manager (if we display
            one), or by changing your browser settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that essential cookies cannot be rejected in some cases
            because they are strictly necessary to provide you with core site
            functionality. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use
            our Website, though your access to some functionality and areas of
            our Website may be restricted.

            How can I control cookies on my browser?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The means by which you can refuse cookies through your browser
            controls vary from browser to browser, so you should visit your
            browser's help menu for more information.

            What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a
            website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time,
            like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear
            gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique
            identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our
            Website or interacted with our content. In many instances, these
            technologies rely on cookies to function properly, so declining
            cookies may impair their functioning.

            Do you use local storage or similar technologies?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Some site features and third-party tools may use local storage (such
            as Local Storage, Session Storage, IndexedDB, or similar) to store
            information on your device. These technologies are used for purposes
            similar to cookies, such as remembering preferences, improving site
            performance, and measuring usage.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can typically clear or control local storage through your
            browser settings. Disabling or clearing it may impact certain
            website functionality.
